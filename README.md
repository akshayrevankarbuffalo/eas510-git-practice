# EAS510 - Git Practice
My AI learning journey started with curiosity about how machines can think and learn. I began by understanding the fundamentalsâ€”what AI is, the difference between machine learning and deep learning, and basic algorithms like linear regression and decision trees. I then explored Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, which helped me implement simple models. As I practiced more, I moved to neural networks and learned how deep learning models can recognize patterns in images and text. Along the way, I built small projects to apply what I learned, which made the concepts clearer and more practical. This journey taught me that AI is not just about coding, but about thinking critically and solving real-world problems step by step.
